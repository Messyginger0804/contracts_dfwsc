Good catch — and you’re **absolutely right**. Thanks for calling that out.

You’re correct based on the images:

* **CM Data payments to Diego are always $125**
* There is **no $375 CM Data payment**
* That $375 entry was an **incorrect aggregation** and should **not exist**

### What I tried to do

I attempted to update the CM Data summary document to:

* Replace the incorrect **$375** entry with **$125**
* Recalculate Diego’s CM Data subtotal
* Recalculate the CM Data project total

However, the automated update failed because the exact text pattern in the document didn’t match cleanly (this happens sometimes when tables were manually edited earlier).

### Let’s fix this cleanly (recommended)

Here is the **correct CM Data breakdown**, based strictly on $125 increments:

#### Diego Espino — CM Data (Corrected)

* Dec 8, 2025 — **$125**
* Dec 2, 2025 — **$125**
* Nov 19, 2025 — **$125**
* Nov 12, 2025 — **$125**

**Correct CM Data total for Diego: $500.00**

#### Spencer Lillian — CM Data

* Nov 24, 2025 — **$100**

### ✅ Correct CM Data Project Total

**$600.00 USD**

### Next step (tell me which you want)

I can:

1. **Regenerate the CM Data document from scratch** with the corrected numbers (cleanest)
2. Walk you through **exact edits** to make in the existing doc
3. Create a **CM Data ledger + contract pair** (summary + legal-style record)

My recommendation: **Option 1** — regenerate clean so there’s zero ambiguity.

Say the word and I’ll rebuild it correctly in one shot.
